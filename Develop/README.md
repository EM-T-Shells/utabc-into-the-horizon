# Starter Code Refactor 

## Description

Purpose of this project was to refactor the source code into semantic markup without making any drastic changes to the overall layout of the webpage.
As developers, we revisit other developers work often for many reasons.
It's much easier to understand the purpose of each area of the code just by reading the semantic tags.

For example, the nav tag tells a developer the element pertains to the navigation section(s). 
Whereas, a div tag can basically mean anything, even if a class attribute is added, it will still require further effort to decipher it's purpose.
For another developer who visits the code, can find it overwhelming and confusing.

The easier the code is to read, the easier it will be to add new features, styles and functions.

Semantic HTML does not just make it a smoother experience for developers.
Screen readers and browsers can interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible. 
Another important reason is Search Engine Optimization. 
It makes the website more search engine friendly enabling it to be ranked higher when a use searches related content or for the website itself.

With little effort at most, you will have produced a well-written code with enhanced accessibility, search engine friendly, and praise from fellow developers.

## Installation

    1. Clone this repository to your desktop
    2. Navigate to the Develop directory
    3. Open the Develop directory in your preferred code editor

## Usage

Within the index.html file, you will find an example of semantic HTML.  
Find the CSS file within assets.  
Browse through the HTML and CSS files to see how one may code a semantic markup.
