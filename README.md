# Starter Code Refactor 

## Description

Purpose of this project was to refactor the source code into semantic markup without making any drastic changes to the overall layout of the webpage.
As developers, we revisit other developers work often for many reasons.
It's much easier to understand the purpose of each area of the code just by reading the semantic tags.
For example, the <nav> tag tells a developer the element pertains to the navigation section(s). 
Whereas, a <div> tag can basically mean anything, even if a class attribute is added, it will still require further effort to decipher it's purpose.
For another developer who visits the code, can find it overwhelming and confusing.
The easier the code is to read, the easier it will be to add new features, styles and functions.
Semantic HTML does not just make it a smoother experience for developers.
Screen readers and browsers can interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible. 
Another important reason is it makes the website more likely to be ranked higher when within the search engine.
This is what is known as Search Engine Optimization.
With little to no effort, you will have a well-written code, enhanced accessibility, that is more search engine friendly,
and praise from fellow developers.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
